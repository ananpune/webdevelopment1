            <h3>Welcome To The New World</h3>
            <p> Welcome to Earth, post apocalypse. You find yourself amongst your people, castaways, with little to their names. The ones that Escaped live a better life and offer a chance. A chance
                to change all of this, change the outcomes of our lives and the trajectory we are on, but to them this is all just a sick game. But winning this game gives you a way to join their
                elite status and live in the comforts that they are able to live with...or destroy them forever.
                <br>
            <p>

            <p> As a forgotten, you find yourself a castaway. Unlike the other factions, you come from a faction where the castaways from other factions have been sent. Unlike other factions,
                you do not have the expertise in their crafts, however are able to use various bits and pieces of the crafts of other factions together in harmony. Could this start
                a new type of alchemy? This might be your edge, this could change everything.
